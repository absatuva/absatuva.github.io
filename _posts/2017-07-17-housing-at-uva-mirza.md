Most of the students from Bangladesh at UVa live in graduate housing as that is the most reasonable option considering transportation and cost. The only problem is, it is hard to get in graduate housing as it is highly demanding apartments, but you should try if you want. If the portal is not open, you may call them in. Among Copeley Hill and UVa Gardens, Copeley Hill is the most convenient but either would work. Apply here.

There are also off-campus housing options like -

* apartments around JPA
* eagles landing
* university heights
